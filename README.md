# IdeaBox

We built an Idea Box for saving your genius, plausible, or swill ideas. The Idea Box features a rating system, the ability add and delete ideas, edit ideas you have already added, and a search feature, for searching the idea cards you have created. All ideas persist in local storage when you re-visit the page, and the site is mobile responsive.

Here is what the Idea Box looks like:
